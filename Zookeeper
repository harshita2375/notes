ZooKeeper, a distributed coordination service, primarily works using Paxos-like consensus algorithms, with its own implementation called Zab (ZooKeeper Atomic Broadcast). Zab is tailored for high-performance, reliable distributed coordination and is simpler than Paxos while fulfilling similar requirements.

Key Components of the Zab Algorithm:
Leader Election:
Ensures that one server acts as the leader while others function as followers.
A leader is responsible for proposing and broadcasting updates.
Atomic Broadcast:
Zab ensures that all servers receive updates in the same order, guaranteeing consistency.
Updates are committed only when a quorum of servers (majority) acknowledges them.
Crash Recovery:
ZooKeeper ensures that even after server crashes, it can recover with a consistent state.
Zab re-establishes a leader and resynchronizes servers to maintain reliability.
Quorum-Based Decision-Making:
Decisions are made when a majority of nodes (a quorum) agree.
This ensures fault tolerance as ZooKeeper can function even if some servers fail.
Properties of Zab:
Sequential Consistency: Clients observe changes in the order they were applied.
Reliability: Once a change is committed, it is durable.
High Availability: As long as a quorum is available, ZooKeeper can process requests.
Partition Tolerance: Zab ensures the system does not split into inconsistent states during network partitions.
How It Works:
Write Requests:
Handled by the leader and broadcast to followers.
A write is considered successful when acknowledged by a quorum.
Read Requests:
Can be served by any node, offering scalability.
If strict consistency is required, the request may be routed to the leader.
This combination of leader-based coordination and quorum-based consensus makes ZooKeeper robust for distributed systems requiring synchronization and coordination, such as Apache Kafka and Hadoop.

Uses of Znodes
Znodes are critical for enabling distributed coordination and synchronization. Here are common use cases:

1. Configuration Management:

Znodes can store configuration settings for distributed applications.
Updates to these znodes are immediately visible to all clients, enabling dynamic configuration changes.
2. Service Discovery:

Applications register themselves with znodes when they start.
Clients can look up services by querying znodes.
3. Leader Election:

Ephemeral sequential znodes are used for leader election.
Clients create znodes with sequential numbers, and the one with the smallest number is elected as the leader.
4. Distributed Locks:

Znodes can act as locks in distributed systems.
Clients create a znode to acquire the lock and delete it to release the lock.
5. Task Assignment:

Znodes can represent tasks in distributed systems.
Workers pick up tasks by modifying or deleting znodes, ensuring no task is executed more than once.
6. State Management:

Znodes can store the state of applications or processes, such as whether a node is healthy or processing a task.
7. Coordination and Synchronization:

Znodes act as barriers or synchronization points, ensuring all clients reach a specific state before proceeding.
Example
Service Discovery:

A distributed application might use ZooKeeper for service discovery as follows:
Services register themselves under a specific znode, e.g., /services/database.
Clients query /services/database to find available database instances.
If a database instance crashes, its ephemeral znode is automatically removed, reflecting the service's unavailability.
