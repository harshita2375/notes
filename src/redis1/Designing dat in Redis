-Be consistent when defining your key space. Because a key can contain
any characters, you can use separators to define a namespace with a
semantic value for your business. An example might be using
cache:project:319:tasks, where the colon acts as a namespace
separator.
-When defining your keys, try to limit them to a reasonable size.
Retrieving a key from storage requires comparison operations, so
keeping keys as small as possible is a good idea. Additionally, smaller
keys are more effective in terms of memory usage.
-Even though keys shouldn’t be exceptionally large, there are no big
performance improvements for extremely small keys. This means you
should design your keys in such a way that combines readability (to help
you) and regular key sizes (to help Redis).
