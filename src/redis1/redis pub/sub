Problem
leverage Redis’s pub/sub functionality to create a light realtime chat system with Node.js and Socket.IO.




🔹 Redis Pub/Sub (Publish-Subscribe) Explained
Redis Pub/Sub is a messaging pattern where publishers send messages to channels, and subscribers listening to those channels receive those messages in real-time.

🔹 How Redis Pub/Sub Works
1️⃣ A publisher sends messages to a channel (e.g., news).
2️⃣ Subscribers who are listening to that channel receive the messages instantly.
3️⃣ If a subscriber is offline, they miss the messages (Redis Pub/Sub does not store messages).

📌 It’s a fire-and-forget system with no message persistence.
