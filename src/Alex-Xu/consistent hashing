Consistent hashing is a special kind of hashing such that when a
hash table is re-sized and consistent hashing is used, only k/n keys need to be remapped on
average, where k is the number of keys, and n is the number of slots.

Hash servers
Using the same hash function f, we map servers based on server IP or name onto the ring.
Figure 5-5 shows that 4 servers are mapped on the hash ring.
Hash keys
that hash function used here is different and there is no modular operation.
.

Server loopkup
To determine which server a key is stored on, we go clockwise from the key position on the
ring until a server is found.

Add a server
Adding a new server will only require redistribution of a fraction of keys.
after a new server 4 is added, only key0 needs to be redistributed. k1, k2, and
k3 remain on the same servers.

problem with basic approach
1. it is impossible to keep the same size
   of partitions on the ring for all servers considering a server can be added or removed.
2. Second, it is possible to have a non-uniform key distribution on the ring.

Virtual Nodes
A virtual node refers to the real node, and each server is represented by multiple virtual nodes
on the ring.

find affected keys
When a server is added or removed, a fraction of data needs to be redistributed.
