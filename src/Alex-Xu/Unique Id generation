Twitter Snowflake
Sign bit: 1 bit. It will always be 0. This is reserved for future uses. It can potentially be

snowflake default epoch 1288834974657, equivalent to Nov 04, 2010, 01:42:54 UTC.
• Datacenter ID: 5 bits, which gives us 2 ^ 5 = 32 datacenters.
• Machine ID: 5 bits, which gives us 2 ^ 5 = 32 machines per datacenter.
• Sequence number: 12 bits. For every ID generated on that machine/process, the sequence
number is incremented by 1. The number is reset to 0 every millisecond.
