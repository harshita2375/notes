document query using inverted index.
Full-Text Search: Lucene allows for fast searching across large text datasets by indexing documents and providing various search capabilities (such as phrase searching, wildcards, fuzzy search, etc.).
Document Indexing: Lucene indexes documents to optimize search performance. Each document can consist of several fields (like title, content, author, etc.).
Tokenization: Lucene breaks down text into individual terms (tokens), removing stopwords and applying stemming algorithms to make searches more efficient.

How Apache Lucene Works:
Indexing:
Lucene first converts a collection of documents (e.g., articles, blogs, etc.) into an inverted index. An inverted index is a data structure where each unique term points to the document IDs where it appears.
During the indexing process, each document is processed to extract its terms (words), which are then stored in the index.
