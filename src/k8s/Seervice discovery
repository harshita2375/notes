The Domain Name System (DNS) is the traditional system of service discovery
on the internet. DNS is designed for relatively stable name resolution with wide
and efficient caching. It is a great system for the internet but falls short in the
dynamic world of Kubernetes.
many systems (for example, Java, by default) look up a name in
DNS directly and never re-resolve.

Service object
--------------
Real service discovery in Kubernetes starts with a Service object.
A Service object is a way to create a named label selector. As we will see, the
Service object does some other nice things for us too.

Service DNS
-----------
cluster IP is virtual it is stable and it is appropriate to give it a DNS
address.All of the issues around clients caching DNS results no longer apply.
Within a namespace, it is as easy as just using the service name to connect to one
of the pods identified by a service.
Kubernetes provides a DNS service exposed to Pods running in the cluster.
ThisKubernetes DNS service was installed as a system component when the cluster
was first created. The DNS service is, itself, managed by Kubernetes and is a
great example of Kubernetes building on Kubernetes.
