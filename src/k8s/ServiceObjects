Service Objects: Kubernetes introduces the concept of Service objects, which define a logical set of pods and a policy to access them. Services act as stable endpoints for other services to interact with. Each service is assigned a unique DNS name and IP address, ensuring that other services can discover and communicate with it reliably. Service objects can be defined using YAML or JSON configuration files and can be managed using Kubernetes APIs or command-line tools.
