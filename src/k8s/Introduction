Immutability
A system upgrade via the apt-get update tool is
a good example of an update to a mutable system. Running apt sequentially
downloads any updated binaries, copies them on top of older binaries, and makes
incremental updates to configuration files. With a mutable system, the current
state of the infrastructure is not represented as a single artifact, but rather an
accumulation of incremental updates and changes.
In these environments, a managed Kubernetes-as-a-Service
(KaaS) provided by a public cloud provider is a great option


In contrast, in an immutable system, rather than a series of incremental updates
and changes, an entirely new, complete image is built, where the update simply
replaces the entire image with the newer image in a single operation.

Immutable container images are at the core of everything that you will build in
Kubernetes.

declarative configuration
Everything in Kubernetes is a declarative configuration object that represents the desired state
of the system.The combination of declarative state stored in a version control system and
Kubernetes’s ability to make reality match this declarative state makes rollback
 of a change trivially easy.
 ocntainers are immutable, and the number of replicas is simply a number in a
 declarative config.f scaling assumes that there are resources available in your
                    cluster to consume. Sometimes you actually need to scale up the cluster itself


self healing system
As a concrete example of this self-healing behavior, if you assert a desired state
of three replicas to Kubernetes, it does not just create three replicas — it
continuously ensures that there are exactly three replicas. If you manually create
a fourth replica Kubernetes will destroy one to bring the number back to three. If
you manually destroy a replica, Kubernetes will create one to again return you to
the desired state.

ourse, devoting even a small team to managing an OS is beyond the scale of
many organizations. In these environments, a managed Kubernetes-as-a-Service
(KaaS) provided by a public cloud provider is a great option.

When your developers build their applications in terms of container images and
deploy them in terms of portable Kubernetes APIs, transferring your application
between environments, or even running in hybrid environments, is simply a
matter of sending the declarative config to a new cluster


Kaniko build image
Building images from a standard Dockerfile typically relies upon interactive access to a Docker daemon,
which requires root access on your machine to run. This can make it difficult to build container images in environments
 that can’t easily or securely expose their Docker daemons, such as Kubernetes clusters (for more about this, check out the 16th oldest open Kubernetes issue).

To overcome these challenges, we’re excited to introduce kaniko, an open-source tool for building container images from a Dockerfile even without privileged root access. With kaniko, we both build an image from a Dockerfile and push it to a registry. Since it doesn’t require any special privileges or permissions, you can run kaniko in a standard Kubernetes cluster, Google Kubernetes Engine, or in any environment that can’t have access to privileges or a Docker daemon.




///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Containers and Kubernetes are foundational concepts in modern software development, particularly for deploying and managing applications at scale. Here’s a breakdown of each:

Containers
Containers are lightweight, standalone software packages that bundle an application and all its dependencies (such as libraries and binaries) to run consistently across different computing environments.
Isolation: Containers run in isolated environments, which helps prevent interference from other applications on the same system, improving reliability and security.
Efficiency: Containers share the host operating system’s kernel, making them more efficient and faster to start up than virtual machines.
Portability: Since containers bundle everything needed for the app, they can run consistently on different platforms, from development environments to testing and production.
The most popular tool for managing containers is Docker, though there are other options like Podman.

Kubernetes
Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and operation of containerized applications.
Originally developed by Google, Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration and is managed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
Kubernetes Core Concepts
Pods:

The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, typically containing one or more containers.
Containers in a pod share storage and network resources and can communicate easily with each other.
Nodes:

Nodes are the worker machines (physical or virtual) that run applications.
Each node has the services necessary to run Pods and is managed by a Kubernetes Master.
Clusters:

A Kubernetes cluster consists of multiple nodes, allowing for high availability and scalability.
The Master Node (Control Plane) manages the worker nodes and orchestrates tasks, while the Worker Nodes handle the actual workload by running Pods.
Services:

Services provide stable networking and load balancing for Pods, which are ephemeral and may get recreated over time.
Deployments:

A Deployment manages the creation and scaling of Pods and ensures a specified number of replicas are running at any given time.
ReplicaSets:

Ensures a stable number of pods are running and manages the scaling up/down of pods in response to load.
ConfigMaps and Secrets:

ConfigMaps store configuration data, while Secrets securely store sensitive information like passwords or API keys.
Namespaces:

Namespaces allow the segmentation of resources within a Kubernetes cluster, useful in large environments with multiple teams or applications.
Kubernetes Features
Self-Healing: Automatically restarts failed containers, replaces or reschedules containers when nodes die, kills containers that don’t respond to user-defined health checks, and doesn’t advertise them until they’re ready.
Auto-Scaling: Automatically scales applications based on CPU utilization or other custom metrics.
Load Balancing: Manages traffic to distribute load across multiple Pods.
Rolling Updates and Rollbacks: Allows updating applications without downtime and can roll back to previous versions if an update fails.
Common Use Cases
Microservices Architecture: Containers are ideal for microservices as each service can be packaged and managed independently. Kubernetes then orchestrates these services and manages their lifecycle.
CI/CD Pipelines: Kubernetes and containers streamline CI/CD processes by enabling rapid deployment, consistent environments, and isolation.
Hybrid and Multi-Cloud: Kubernetes can run on any infrastructure, making it possible to build applications that span multiple clouds or combine on-premises and cloud infrastructure.
Example Workflow in Kubernetes
Define Configuration: Use YAML files to define the desired state for Pods, Services, and other resources.
Deploy with kubectl: Use the kubectl command-line tool to deploy resources to a Kubernetes cluster.
Scale and Monitor: Kubernetes will automatically manage the desired number of replicas and balance load, while monitoring tools track resource usage and health.
Update with Zero Downtime: Roll out new versions of applications via Kubernetes deployments without downtime. Kubernetes performs rolling updates, gradually replacing older versions with the newer one.
Together, containers and Kubernetes simplify the deployment and management of applications across distributed environments, making them crucial for modern, scalable, and resilient application development.

Containers and Pods are both core components in Kubernetes, but they serve different roles:

Containers
A container is a lightweight, standalone package that includes an application and its dependencies, allowing it to run consistently across different environments. Containers use a common host OS kernel, making them efficient to start and stop.
Containers run isolated from each other and are typically managed using container runtime engines like Docker or containerd.
Containers are the fundamental units of software packaging but lack orchestration capabilities on their own.
Pods
A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It is essentially a wrapper for one or more containers that are intended to work closely together.
Pods provide shared resources like networking and storage to containers within them, allowing them to communicate more efficiently and share data.
Unlike containers, Pods are ephemeral and designed to be short-lived; Kubernetes automatically manages Pods, recreating them if they fail or need to be updated.
A Pod usually contains a single container, but it can hold multiple tightly-coupled containers. For instance, you might have a main application container along with a "sidecar" container for logging or monitoring within the same Pod.
Key Differences
Feature	Container	Pod
Definition	A standalone instance running an application	A Kubernetes object containing one or more containers
Purpose	Runs an isolated application instance	Encapsulates one or more containers with shared resources
Orchestration	Lacks built-in orchestration and management	Managed by Kubernetes, enabling scaling and self-healing
Networking	Each container has its own IP (outside Kubernetes)	All containers in a Pod share the same network namespace (IP)
Use Cases	Single application component	Groups of containers that need to work closely together
Example Use Case
Suppose you have a web application container that serves HTML and needs to log traffic. You might create a Pod with:

One container for the web server.
Another "sidecar" container for logging.
Both containers will share the same network space and can easily access shared volumes, allowing them to work as a single, tightly integrated unit within a Kubernetes Pod.
