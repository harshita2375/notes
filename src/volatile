The `volatile` keyword in Java is used to indicate that a variable's value may be modified by multiple threads that are not synchronized. Essentially, it tells the JVM that the value of the variable should always be read directly from main memory and not from the CPU cache, and any write to the variable should be immediately flushed to main memory, ensuring visibility across threads.

Here are some key points about the `volatile` keyword:

1. **Visibility**: When a variable is declared as `volatile`, changes made by one thread to the variable's value are immediately visible to other threads. This ensures that updates to the variable are not cached locally by threads and are always read from main memory, preventing thread-specific values.

2. **No Atomicity or Consistency**: While `volatile` ensures visibility, it does not provide atomicity for compound actions (such as incrementing a counter) or enforce consistency among multiple variables. For such cases, you would typically need to use synchronization mechanisms like locks or atomic classes.

3. **Performance**: Using `volatile` can have a performance cost compared to non-volatile variables, as it may involve more memory reads and writes due to the avoidance of CPU caching. However, this cost is usually negligible unless the variable is accessed very frequently.

4. **Use Cases**: `volatile` is commonly used for flags or status indicators that are frequently updated by one thread and read by other threads. It's also used for variables shared between threads where simple read/write operations are sufficient and where atomicity is not required.

5. **Memory Barrier**: The use of `volatile` inserts memory barriers before and after accesses to the variable, ensuring that memory operations are properly ordered with respect to other memory operations.

Here's a simple example demonstrating the usage of `volatile`:

```java
public class VolatileExample {
    private volatile boolean flag = false;

    public void setFlag(boolean value) {
        flag = value;
    }

    public boolean getFlag() {
        return flag;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        VolatileExample example = new VolatileExample();

        // Thread 1: sets the flag to true
        new Thread(() -> {
            example.setFlag(true);
            System.out.println("Thread 1: flag set to true");
        }).start();

        // Thread 2: reads the flag value
        new Thread(() -> {
            while (!example.getFlag()) {
                // Spin until flag becomes true
            }
            System.out.println("Thread 2: flag is true");
        }).start();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `volatile` keyword ensures that changes made to the `flag` variable by Thread 1 are immediately visible to Thread 2, without the need for explicit synchronization.
