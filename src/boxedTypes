Boxed primitive types in Java refer to the classes that wrap primitive data types. For example, Integer wraps int, Double wraps double, and so on. Here are the pros and cons of using boxed primitive types:

Pros:

Allows Null Values: Unlike primitive types, boxed types can hold null values. This can be useful in situations where you need to represent the absence of a value.
Compatibility with Generics: Boxed types can be used with Java generics. This is particularly useful when working with collections (e.g., List<Integer>), where primitive types cannot be used directly.
Can Be Used with Collections: Collections in Java (such as ArrayList, HashMap, etc.) can only store objects, not primitive types. Boxed types provide a way to use primitive types with collections.
Utility Methods: Boxed types often provide utility methods for converting between primitive types and strings, as well as methods for arithmetic operations and comparisons.
Cons:

Memory Overhead: Boxed types consume more memory than their primitive counterparts because they are objects and carry additional overhead (such as object headers).
Performance Overhead: Unboxing (converting a boxed type to its corresponding primitive type) and autoboxing (converting a primitive type to its corresponding boxed type) operations can introduce performance overhead, especially in performance-critical code.
Equality Comparison: When using == to compare boxed types, you're comparing references, not values. This can lead to unexpected behavior if you're not careful. For value comparison, you should use the equals() method instead.
Potential for NullPointerExceptions: Since boxed types can hold null values, using them without proper null checks can lead to NullPointerExceptions.
