The practical effect of this in our example is that an object of type Car can be assigned to a
variable of type Vehicle. That is, it would be legal to say
Vehicle myVehicle = myCar;
or even
Vehicle myVehicle = new Car();

After either of these statements, the variable myVehicle holds a reference to a Vehicle object
that happens to be an instance of the subclass, Car. The object “remembers” that it is in fact
a Car, and not just a Vehicle. Information about the actual class of an object is stored as part
of that object. It is even possible to test whether a given object belongs to a given class, using
the instanceof operator. The test:
if (myVehicle instanceof Car) ...
determines whether the object referred to by myVehicle is in fact a car.
