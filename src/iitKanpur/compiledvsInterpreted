 Complied
 Once the translation is done, the machine-language program can be run any number of times, but of course it can only
be run on one type of computer (since each type of computer has its own individual machine
language). If the program is to run on another type of computer it has to be re-translated,
using a different compiler, into the appropriate machine language.
Interpreted
There is an alternative to compiling a high-level language program. Instead of using a
compiler, which translates the program all at once, you can use an interpreter, which translates
it instruction-by-instruction, as necessary. An interpreter is a program that acts much like a
CPU, with a kind of fetch-and-execute cycle. In order to execute a program, the interpreter
runs in a loop in which it repeatedly reads one instruction from the program, decides what is
necessary to carry out that instruction, and then performs the appropriate machine-language
commands to do so

Interpreted and compiler
The designers of Java chose to use a combination of compilation and interpretation. Programs written in Java are compiled into machine language, but it is a machine language for
a computer that doesn’t really exist. This so-called “virtual” computer is known as the Java
virtual machine. The machine language for the Java virtual machine is called Java bytecode. There is no reason why Java bytecode could not be used as the machine language of a
real computer, rather than a virtual computer.
ava bytecode program can be run on any computer that has such an interpreter.
This is one of the essential features of Java: the same compiled program can be run on many
different types of computers
