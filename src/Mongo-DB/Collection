Collections
A collection is a group of documents. If a document is the MongoDB analog of a row
in a relational database, then a collection can be thought of as the analog to a table.
A collection is identified by its name. Collection names can be any UTF-8 string,


Schema-Free
Collections are schema-free. This means that the documents within a single collection
can have any number of different “shapes.”
For example, both of the following documents could be stored in a
single collection:

{"greeting" : "Hello, world!"}
{"foo" : 5}


- It is much faster to get a list of collections than to extract a list of the types in a
  collection.
- We begin to impose some structure on our documents when we create indexes
