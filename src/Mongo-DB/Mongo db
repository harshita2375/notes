Document Db
-
MongoDB is a document-oriented database, not a relational one. The primary reason
for moving away from the relational model is to make scaling out easier, but there are
some other advantages as well.
The basic idea is to replace the concept of a “row” with a more flexible model, the
“document.” By allowing embedded documents and arrays, the document-oriented
approach makes it possible to represent complex hierarchical relationships with a single
record

Mode of interaction
MongoDB uses a binary wire protocol as the primary mode of interaction
with the server (as opposed to a protocol with more overhead, like HTTP/REST)

Features

Indexing
MongoDB supports generic secondary indexes, allowing a variety of fast queries,
and provides unique, compound, and geospatial indexing capabilities as well.

Aggregation
MongoDB supports MapReduce and other aggregation tools

File storage
Mon
goDB supports an easy-to-use protocol for storing large files and file metadata

adminitration
If a master server goes down, MongoDB can automatically
failover to a backup slave and promote the slave to a master. In a distributed environment,
 the cluster needs to be told only that a new node exists to o automatically integrate
 and configure it

//
document
A document is the basic unit of data for MongoDB, roughly equivalent to a row in
a relational database management system (but much more expressive).

collection
a collection can be thought of as the schema-free equivalent of a table.

instance
A single instance of MongoDB can host multiple independent databases, each of
 which can have its own collections and permissions.

_id
Every document has a special key, "_id", that is unique across the document’s
collection.
