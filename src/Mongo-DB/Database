ddition to grouping documents by collection, MongoDB groups collections into
databases. A single instance of MongoDB can host several databases, each of which can
be thought of as completely independent.

A database has its own permissions, and each database is stored in separate files on disk.
 A good rule of thumb is to store all data for
a single application in the same database. Separate databases are useful when storing
data for several application or users on the same MongoDB server.
