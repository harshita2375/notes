lasticsearch is a real-time distributed search and analytics engine. It allows you to
explore your data at a speed and at a scale never before possible.

However, Elasticsearch is much more than just Lucene and much more than “just” full
text search. It is also:
• A distributed real-time document store where every field is indexed and searchable.
• A distributed search engine with real-time analytics.
• Capable of scaling to hundreds of servers and petabytes of structured and unstruc‐
tured data.

Elasticsearch is document oriented, meaning that it stores entire objects or documents.
Not only does it store them, it also indexes the contents of each document in order to
make them searchable.

JSON
ElsticSearch uses JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) as the serialization format for
 documents.


Inverted index
Relational databases add an index, such as a B-Tree index, to specific columns in
order to improve the speed of data retrieval. Elasticsearch and Lucene use a struc‐
ture called an inverted index for exactly the same purpose.
By default, every field in a document is indexed (has an inverted index) and thus is
searchable. A field without an inverted index is not searchable. We discuss inverted
indexes in more detail.

Add an index
To add data to Elasticsearch, we need an index —
