client libraries handle service discovery, failure modes, logging, and
other aspects that arenâ€™t actually about the nature of the service itself. Without these
shared clients, it would be hard to ensure that each piece of client/server communications
behaved well at the massive scale at which Netflix operates.

Versioning
----------
Major.minor.patch

major changes --> may have incomptibale changes
minor- new changee , hsould be backward compatible.

co-exist different version
--------------------------
n case of breaking changes, changes that clients are not comptible , we can maintain
2 different version of a service.
coexisting different service for short period of time makes sense but not for e
exytended periods as this would require maintianing two codebases.
putting changes in both repos etc.
like blue/green deployment and canary .
