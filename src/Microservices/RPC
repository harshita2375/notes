Remote procedure call refers to the technique of making a local call and having it execute
on a remote service somewhere.
Many implementations of RPC, though, hide too much.
The drive in some forms of RPC to make remote method
calls look like local method calls hides the fact that these two things are very different.
I can make large numbers of local, in-process calls without worrying overly about the
performance.
With RPC, though, the cost of marshalling and un-marshalling payloads can
be significant, not to mention the time taken to send things over the network.

BrittleNess - any change ins erver needs  to regenerate client stubs as well.
