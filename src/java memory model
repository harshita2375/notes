1. where primitives are stored in java
Primitives can be stored on both the stack and the heap. They are stored on the stack when they are local variables to methods,
in other words, parameters to the method or variables declared inside the method itself.
Primitives are stored on the heap when they are members of a class, that is, instance variable

2. how objects are stored in java
Most Java objects are stored in the heap memory. The heap is a region of memory that is shared among all threads of a Java application. When you create an object using the new keyword, it is allocated memory from the heap. T
he Java garbage collector manages the heap by reclaiming memory from objects that are no longer in use


--------------------------------------------------------------
stack memory
The stack memory for a Java process is a region of memory dedicated to storing method call frames and local variables. Each thread in a Java process has its own stack memory.

The exact size of the stack memory for each thread can vary depending on the JVM implementation and runtime parameters. Typically, the stack memory size is fixed when a thread is created and is relatively small compared to the heap memory.

In Java, you can specify the stack size using the -Xss
ss option specifies the stack size for each individual thread in the Java application, not for the entire application as a whole.
