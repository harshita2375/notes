redis sentinel setup , can you explain more about it


ChatGPT said:
Sure! Let's break down Redis Sentinel and how it's used for high availability in a Redis deployment.

🔄 What is Redis Sentinel?
Redis Sentinel is a supervision system for Redis. It provides:

Monitoring – Check if your master and replicas are working as expected.

Notification – Alert if something goes wrong.

Automatic failover – Promote a replica to master if the master goes down.

Configuration provider – Applications can query Sentinel to get the current master’s IP/port.

🧱 Basic Architecture
A typical Redis Sentinel setup has:

1 Master

1 or more Replicas

3 or more Sentinel processes (for quorum & failover)

Example:
pgsql

⚙️ How Failover Works
Sentinel detects master is down (using ping checks and quorum).

Sentinels vote to confirm the failure (quorum must agree).

Sentinel promotes a replica to be the new master.

Remaining replicas are reconfigured to replicate from the new master.

Application is informed (or can query) about the new master.

📁 Configuration Basics
Redis Server config (replica):
conf

replicaof <master-ip> <master-port>
Sentinel config (sentinel.conf):

port 26379

# Monitor master <name> <ip> <port> <quorum>
sentinel monitor mymaster 127.0.0.1 6379 2

# Timeout to detect down (in milliseconds)
sentinel down-after-milliseconds mymaster 5000

# Failover timeout
sentinel failover-timeout mymaster 10000

# How many sentinels need to agree to start failover
sentinel parallel-syncs mymaster 1
You need to run at least 3 Sentinel instances to ensure a reliable quorum.
